<title>Pingpong against Parkinson's disease</title>
<description>An estimated 10 million people worldwide have Parkinson's disease, an incurable condition that impacts how the brain controls movement. Some Parkinson's patients have found an unusual way to keep their symptoms at bay: pingpong. Though there aren't many studies to prove the sport's positive effects on Parkinson's patients, the 'PingPongParkinson' network has been growing fast. It started in the US. In Germany, Silke Kind is one of the players in charge: she says pingpong keeps her moving.</description>
